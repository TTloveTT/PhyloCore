# PhyloCore
PhyloCore is an application that uses a phylogeny-based algorithm to identify the core microbiota taxa at the proper taxonomic levels. Two flavors of PhyloCore are provided. One in python (PhyloCore_python.tar.gz) and one in perl (PhyloCore_perl.tar.gz). The python version works in both Unix/Linux and Mac. The perl version only works in Unix/Linux.
